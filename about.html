            <p>In 2015, the Blue Mountain Project received a grant from the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu">Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton
                University</a> to develop Blue Mountain Springs.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The Blue Mountain Project is digging virtual wells into its growing research collection
            of digitized avant-garde periodicals.</p>
        <p>By one measure, Blue Mountain is a thematic research collection of periodicals that both
            chronicle and embody the revolutions in art, music, literature, architecture,
            advertising, and graphic design out of which modernity emerged. Many of these magazines
            are rare and inaccessible to scholarship, but they are vital to the study of modern
            culture.</p>
        <p>By another measure, Blue Mountain is a linguistic corpus containing over 12 million words
            in many languages, making it a rich lode for computational linguists and digital
            philologists, who seek clean sets of thematically linked data on which to conduct basic
            research in natural-language processing.</p>
        <p>By either measure, Blue Mountain is a large and heterogeneous resource. And it has
            coalesced at a time when intellectual prospectors of all stripes are becoming familiar
            with computational methods of research and analysis. As they do, they are demanding new
            ways to work with digitized texts besides turning virtual pages. As a research project
            whose mission is to serve the needs of these scholars and students, we must respond to
            this demand by providing new modes of discovery and access, both shallow and deep.</p>
        <p>Blue Mountain's first phase, supported with generous funding from the Princeton
            University Library and the National Endowment for the Humanities, emphasized traditional
            digital library concerns: collection-building and metadata creation. The end result of
            phase one is a useful traditional digital library measured by the traditional measures
            of discovery and access: it has a catalog that can be searched and browsed, and it has a
            web-based viewer that enables users to look at high-resolution reproductions of the
            pages.</p>
        <p>But the real value of Blue Mountain lies beneath the surface, in the richly encoded
            metadata we have created. Most digital library applications (including our current
            implementation) make little use of this data, concentrating instead on supporting
            traditional forms of discovery and access. We planned Blue Mountain carefully to serve a
            far deeper and broader range of research uses. In this proposal we seek funding to
            develop far more sophisticated ways to expose Blue Mountain's resources to an entirely
            new audience of users: the scholars and scientists engaged in the activities loosely
            defined as "digital humanities."</p>
        <p>What exactly constitutes "digital humanities" is itself a topic of vigorous debate. We
            take /digital humanities/ to refer to a set of practices that use computers and
            machine-readable representations of cultural heritage materials to investigate questions
            relating to space, time, and human community. Blue Mountain's domain -- the Western
            Avant-Garde in literature, art, music, and architecture -- is full of these sorts of
            questions. What was the Avant-Garde? When did it begin? Where? In what ways was it
            international? In what ways did it cross disciplinary boundaries?</p>
        <p>In order to answer these questions, one must be able to place events and people in space
            and time and trace the relationships among them. To do so, information scientists and
            digital humanities researchers need to bypass reader-oriented interfaces and access
            full-text data directly and programmatically for use with their own analytical tools,
            with web tools like Voyant, Palladio, and Raw, or with available tools and toolkits like
            Gephi, Mallet, or NLTK.</p>
        <p>Blue Mountain Springs is intended to make Blue Mountain "an abundant source of clean
            data" by providing an application programming interface (API) to Blue Mountain's
            metadata, page images, and machine-readable full-text transcriptions. Services like Blue
            Mountain Springs erode the distinctions between digital libraries, data sets, and data
            bases. Blue Mountain Springs will make it easier for humanities researchers to get their
            objects of study into stand-alone tools. By presenting Blue Mountain as a collection of
            resources, we will enable users to construct URLs that point to specific items or data
            sets of interest, like a particular article or set of articles, a set of contributors, a
            set of places mentioned in a set of texts, or a set of images, and that deliver the data
            in formats that may be piped into analytical tools.</p>
