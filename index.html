<p>Blue Mountain Springs is a set of Application Program Interfaces
(APIs) to <a href="http://bluemountain.princeton.edu">Blue
Mountain</a>, the web resource of the Blue Mountain Project, whose
mission is to create a freely available digital repository of
important, rare, and fragile texts that both chronicle and embody the
emergence of cultural modernity.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Blue Mountain Project received a grant from the
<a href="http://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu">Center for Digital Humanities
